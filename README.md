The User Interface makes it easy for users to search for their favorite topics on various platforms - TikTok, Twitter/X, and Instagram.

## How to Use:
The user will first type in their desired search topic, followed by the number of searches they would like returned (with a maximum of 7). The user will then select one of the three search options and click the green search button to generate results.

## Possible Results: TikTok
The TikTok results can display: suggested user profiles, a discovery tag, or a suggested video.

### Discovery Tag Note

Due to embedding issues with TikTok discovery tags, the user will be prompted to click on the discover image to open the discover tag link in a separate window. Unfortunately no preview of the discovery tag will be shown.

### Video Preview Note:

The embedded video will automatically start once it is fully loaded.


## Possible Results: Twitter/X

### User Timeline Preview:

The user will be able to see the posts from an account using the scroll bar and click the user profile to open in another tab.

### User Post:
It will sometimes suggest a single tweet that it thinks the user might like. 


## Possible Results: Instagram

### User Post:
It will sometimes suggest a single post that it thinks the user might like.
